# Introduction

Welcome to the web site for the ox **t**rading **a**nalysis
**n**etwork (`ox_tan` for short). The `ox_tan` software
program provides tools to keep a trading journal and analyze
your trades. The following are some features provided by `ox_tan`:

  1. Completely free for as many trades as you want.
  2. Make a note when you enter trades, categorizing the entry and/or exit strategy, along with stop-loss, risk target, etc.
  3. Upload trades from your broker and link them to your notes.
  4. You keep your own data and never have to provide it to third parties.
  5. Keep track of your trades and get analysis and statistics on what
     you are doing well or poorly.

# History and Future Plans

The original motivation to develop `ox_tan` was to try out the `Flask` web framework for python in managing personal trades.  Given that it started as a personal hobby project, it is a little rough around the edges at the moment. That said, the project went well and helped in tracking and improving trading performance so it seemed worth releasing publicly. Hopefully others will find it useful as well. If so, AOCKS may clean up the code and open source `ox_tan` so others can modify and contribute as well.

Comments, suggestions, and feedback are welcome at `ox_tan@aocks.com`.
